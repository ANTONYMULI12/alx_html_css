## Overview

This project provides a responsive web design, with a specific focus on mobile-first interaction and aesthetics. The design has been implemented using Figma as a design tool, with detailed interaction specifications for different screen sizes and element states. The web page will switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.
